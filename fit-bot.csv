What is fitness?,"Fitness is the ability to perform activity at a moderate to vigorous level of intensity without tiring easily.

METs can be measured during an exercise (treadmill or bicycle) stress test, and they are commonly performed at a doctor's office to investigate cardiac or pulmonary disease.
